# Cost Reminder

Display the cost-aware mode status:

```
Cost-aware mode active.
Model: [current model] | /save to log | /clear resets context

Tips:
- Use `cq` (haiku) for simple queries
- Use `cc` (sonnet) for general coding
- Use `co` (opus) for complex architecture
- At ~50 messages, consider /clear
```
