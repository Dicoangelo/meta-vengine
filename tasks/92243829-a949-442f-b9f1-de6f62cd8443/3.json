Load ALL 21 project architectures, dependency graph, package versions, meta-vengine state. Generate ecosystem plan with topological ordering and priority ranking.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n- 8-12 single-project innovations\n- 3-5 cross-project synergies\n- 1-2 package updates\n- Valid dependency-ordered roadmap\n- Cost: <$3 (3 Opus agents, optimized context)\n\nFiles to create:\n- ~/researchgravity/orchestrator/synthesize_ecosystem.py (~700 lines)",
