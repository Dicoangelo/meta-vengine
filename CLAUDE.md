# Session Protocols

## On Session Start

Display this once at the beginning:
```
Cost-aware mode active.
Model: [current model] | /save to log | /clear resets context
```

## Cost Efficiency

Track approximate message count. At ~50 messages, suggest `/clear` if context allows. At ~100+, recommend fresh session.

If on Opus doing routine tasks, suggest Sonnet (`cc`). Reserve Opus for complex architecture only.

After major task completions, offer a checkpoint summary:
- What was done
- Files changed
- Next steps

If user sends 3+ small sequential requests, offer to batch them.

## Session End Protocol

When user says "done", "quit", "ending", or similar:
1. Remind them: "Run `/save` to save this session before quitting."

## User Context

- GitHub: Dicoangelo
- Projects: OS-App, Agentic Kernel, Antigravity ecosystem
- Aliases: `cq` (haiku), `cc` (sonnet), `co` (opus), `cstats`
- Skills: `/cost`, `/save`, `/history`

### Usage Patterns Observed
- Peak productivity hours: 15:00, 14:00, 20:00
- Dominant session type: architecture (35%)
- Average session length: 265 messages
- Total sessions: 104 | Messages: 27,521

### Optimized Behaviors
- For architecture: Use Opus for system design, pre-load research papers
- For debugging: Start with /debug, escalate to Opus if >3 iterations
- For research: Pre-load learnings via `prefetch --papers`
- Cache efficiency: 99.88% - maintain by reusing context within sessions

### Cost Efficiency Rules
- Batch threshold: 3 sequential requests -> suggest batching
- Model routing: Use DQ scoring (validity 40% + specificity 30% + correctness 30%)
- Context: 50 messages suggest /clear | 100+ recommend fresh session

### Proactive Context
- Pattern prediction enabled via `prefetch --pattern <type>`
- Auto-detect session type from initial queries
- Pre-load relevant memory based on detected pattern
